# Safe Crack
This watchOS application that I built is a game to crack a safe by guessing some random numbers. To make it more fun, I designed it in such a way that the player can use digital crown to simulate the combination the combination lock dials that he/she sees on the safe. The players also gets some haptic feedback that taps their wrist when they get each part of the combination correct. 

In this project, I learnt about how to run some code after a delay by using Grand Central Dispatch. I also learnt about haptic feedback, delegate methods, typecasting and shuffle arrays.
